    <strong>"A Quality Investing Tool... Switching to Investment Account Manager has taken me to a whole new level. Now I'm spending a lot less time keeping my portfolios up to date, while getting much more useful information in return... All in all, an excellent product. I use it nearly every day to help me manage my investments and my trading systems."</strong><br>

    <strong>"The BEST portfolio manager out there! Over the years I've tried many portfolio managers and without question IAM is the best! In fact, it's the only one I've been using for the last 4 or 5 years... I always receive an email answer within a few hours and sometimes the answer is immediate. I highly recommend this program."</strong><br>

          "Best in class. I switched to Investment Account Manager from Captools for individuals over three years ago, and I'll tell you it has been one of the best moves I have made. IAM is a very comprehensive, self-contained, simple to use trade recording and reporting package that proves its value many times over."<br>

      "Great Product with Great Customer Support. I was a long time user of Captools. About a year ago, I transferred all my investment data to IAM. The transition was smooth and I got great tech support. I've been using this product for managing multiple portfolios of stocks and mutual funds. The user interface is very intuitive and the software is very robust."<br>

      "A Great Program! I have been using IAM for about 3 years and it's NAIC Better Investing predecessor for another 3 years prior to that. I track several investment portfolios of my own and family members, which contain a mix of stock, mutual funds &amp; bonds. I have found the software to be very easy to use and reliable. This software has made my portfolio tracking and analysis work quite easy!"<br>

      "Highly recommend this excellent, dependable software. I've used this product for years, starting years ago with Better Investing, and depend heavily on it. Easy to use. Separate portfolios, but can aggregate as you choose. Gain/loss information and summaries are easy and make tax time a breeze."
