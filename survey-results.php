    <li>The best feature -- and why I use IAM -- is accurate reporting of portfolio balances and returns. Also, it is easy to combine accounts (e.g., all IRAs or all taxable accounts) for reporting balances and returns.</li>
    <li>Being able to judge an individual stock's performance over a variety of time periods.</li>
    <li>It is reliable, I've used IAM since the 3.5-inch floppy disk days.  Many years of data reliably stored and retrieved.</li>

    <li>Ability to track realized gains/losses, interest income and dividend income throughout the year for tax planning (and to verify the accuracy of the monthly brokerage statements).</li>
