  The founders of QUANT IX SOFTWARE Inc., the developer of the Investment Account Manager software programs, have been registered and regulated investment advisors since the 1980s. As such, we instinctively developed (since 1985) an investment management software program incorporating the fiduciary rule principal in its design and features. This important distinction is yet another reason why our customers know we always put their welfare first.  And as you'll gather from the results listed below from our recent survey (completed July 2021), we've been successful in building long-term relationships with our users that have found IAM3 Individual our best release yet for successfully managing their investment portfolios.<br>

    <li>I find IAM invaluable in tracking our finances and really would have considerable difficulty doing without it.</li>
    <li>Love the ease of use and simplicity of application. Reports allow me to make decisions on short/long term sales and performance. I really appreciate the quick & helpful responses I've always received from tech support when requested.</li>
    <li>We are long term users of IAM and have managed portfolios both for clients and family for many years. It is a great way to save time, do sector comparisons, monitor results, and plan for taxes. We would be lost without it!</li>
    <li>Not only does IAM meet every need I have with my investments, but the customer service is outstanding.</li>
    <li>Very helpful for tracking allocations, especially as the market recovered from the Covid bottom.</li>
    <li>Have been using IAM for over 15 years and love it. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li>IAM has helped me track multiple family accounts for many years & has been a boon to my sanity. I find the system easy to use & helps me make decisions on what to change - what capital gains are & when I should take them.</li>
    <li>IAM is a great tool for keeping track of portfolio transactions. Tech support is outstanding.</li>
    <li>IAM has made me keep an interest in my investments instead of giving up and turning them over to a company to invest for me. I feel I have invested wisely with IAM's help.</li>
    <li>The program is excellent. It meets all of my needs and knowing that I have access to technical support if necessary is KEY! Thanks.</li>
    <li>I love the ability to look at IRAs, 401Ks, company retirement plans, and savings accounts in one consolidated place. It is so helpful to look at them individually and in total without have to rewrite/copy data from each account when evaluating savings status & adjusting for possible changes.</li>
    <li>Like program so much that I also purchased for my daughter when she joined our investment club to learn about investing. Wanted her to use for her personal portfolio.</li>
    <li>There are many strengths.  The most important one for me is the accuracy of transactions and recordkeeping.  Close behind is the different forms of reporting that allow me to use that information for decision making and tax planning/preparation.</li>
    <li>The best feature -- and why I use IAM -- is accurate reporting of portfolio balances and returns. Also, it is easy to combine accounts (e.g., all IRAs or all taxable accounts) for reporting balances and returns.</li>
    <li>Being able to judge an individual stock's performance over a variety of time periods.</li>
    <li>It is reliable, I've used IAM since the 3.5-inch floppy disk days.  Many years of data reliably stored and retrieved.</li>
    <li>Reporting across (i.e., combining) portfolios. Calculating internal rates of return for variable time periods.</li>
    <li>Quick, easy, accurate investment valuation and performance reporting.</li>
    <li>Accuracy and functionality for the price. IAM also handles option transactions much better than other portfolio management tools I've used.</li>
    <li>Ease of use and program flexibility once all initial data is loaded into the program.  It's a very powerful tool and I would never have continued investing without it.</li>
