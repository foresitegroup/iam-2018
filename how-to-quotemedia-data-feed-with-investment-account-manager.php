  QuoteMedia data feed (available for an annual low cost subscription price) provides automatic fundamental analysis and fund composition data download into Investment Account Manager. The QuoteMedia&trade; data feed is particularly helpful at month end, so with just a few simple clicks, your investments reflect updated fundamental and descriptive data.  Note: The QuoteMedia data feed is included with Investment Account Manager Professional version.<br>
  <br>

  QuoteMedia&trade; offers users the ability to automatically populate and update the fundamental and descriptive data for common stocks. This data, when incorporated into Investment Account Manager, provides the information for powerful fundamental ratio analysis, screening, and asset allocation analysis. Fundamental ratio analysis offers a "snap shot" of a company's value, where the analysis is a review of a firm's financial report.<br>

  The QuoteMedia data feed also provides the ability to automatically populate the fund allocation analysis (breakdown by allocation percentages for asset type, sector and size compositions) for mutual funds and exchange traded funds.  These allocation percentages are used in allocation reports to include the portfolio compositions of any funds (mutual funds and exchange traded funds) held in your portfolio when Investment Account Manager derives asset allocation percentages. This means each fund's proportional impact (amount invested in cash, bonds and stocks, by sector, by size) will be included along with any individual holdings of each asset type held outside of your funds, providing a total allocation analysis of your portfolio.<br>
